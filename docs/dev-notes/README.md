## Building the MarkdownLinkCheckLogParser solution

### Building with Visual Studio

1) Clone the repo and open the **MarkdownLinkCheckLogParser.sln** solution file at `/MarkdownLinkCheckLogParser`.
2) Press build on Visual Studio.

### Building with dotnet CLI

1) Clone the repo and browse to the solution's directory at `/MarkdownLinkCheckLogParser` using your favorite shell.
2) Run **`dotnet build MarkdownLinkCheckLogParser.sln`** to build the source of the CLI app.

## Running MarkdownLinkCheckLogParser solution tests

### Run tests with Visual Studio

1) Clone the repo and open the **MarkdownLinkCheckLogParser.sln** solution file at `/MarkdownLinkCheckLogParser`.
2) Go to the test explorer in Visual Studio and run tests.

**Note:** [Remote testing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/remote-testing?view=vs-2022) with WSL is configured on the solution which enables you to run the tests locally on Linux or on Windows. You can view the configuration file at [testenvironments.json](/MarkdownLinkCheckLogParser/testenvironments.json). To run the tests on Linux you need to have at least `Visual Studio 2022` and the Linux distro `Ubuntu-20.04` installed on [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

### Run tests with dotnet CLI

1) Clone the repo and browse to the solution's directory at `/MarkdownLinkCheckLogParser` using your favorite shell.
2) Run **`dotnet test MarkdownLinkCheckLogParser.sln`** to run tests.

## Building and running the Docker container action

The steps below show how to run the Docker container action against a set of test data provided by the repo. However you can follow the same steps and provide any data you wish to test.

1) Clone the repo and browse to the repo's directory.
2) Run `docker build -t mlc-log-parser .`
3) Run the docker container and pass at least the required inputs by executing:

```
docker run --rm -v ${pwd}:/workspace --workdir /workspace mlc-log-parser `
parse-log `
--auth-token <github token> `
--repo <repo> `
--run-id <run id> `
--job-name '<job name>' `
--step-name '<step name>'
```

## Projects wide configuration

The [Directory.Build.props](/MarkdownLinkCheckLogParser/Directory.Build.props) enables several settings as well as adds some common NuGet packages for all projects.

There is a set of NuGet packages that are only applied in test projects by using the condition `"'$(IsTestProject)' == 'true'"`. To make this work the `csproj` for the test projects must have the `<IsTestProject>true</IsTestProject>` property defined. Adding this property manually shouldn't be needed because it should be added by the `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` package however there seems to be an issue with this when running tests outside of Visual Studio. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/3790#issuecomment-1100773198) for more info.

## Deterministic Build configuration

Following the guide from [Deterministic Builds](https://github.com/clairernovotny/DeterministicBuilds) the `ContinuousIntegrationBuild` setting on the [Directory.Build.props](/MarkdownLinkCheckLogParser/Directory.Build.props) is set to true, if the build is being executed in GitHub actions.

## Repository configuration

From all the GitHub repository settings the configurations worth mentioning are:

- **Automatically delete head branches** is enabled: after pull requests are merged, head branches are deleted automatically.
- **Branch protection rules**. There is a branch protection rule for the the `main` branch that will enforce the following:
  - Require status checks to pass before merging.
  - Require branches to be up to date before merging.
  - Require linear history.

## GitHub Workflows

For more information about the GitHub workflows configured for this repo go [here](/docs/dev-notes/workflows/README.md).

## GitHub marketplace

This action is published to the [GitHub marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/markdown-link-check-log-parser). See here for more information on [how to publish or remove an action from the marketplace](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace).

**Currently there is no workflow setup to publish this action to the marketplace. The publishing act is a manual process following the instructions above.**

## Note about the Docker container action

This repo provides a [Docker container action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action). If parsing the log from the `Markdown Link Check` action fails then the action [will fail](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/creating-actions/setting-exit-codes-for-actions#setting-a-failure-exit-code-in-a-docker-container-action). See here for more information about the [syntax for a Docker container action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#runs-for-docker-container-actions).

To understand better how the action builds and executes the Docker container look at the log for the steps that build and run the action.

### As of writing this, the log for building the docker action looks as follows

```
/usr/bin/docker build 
-t 4cd98f:236c6972581e50e94bc7f786208c8965 
-f "/home/runner/work/markdown-link-check-log-parser/markdown-link-check-log-parser/v1/Dockerfile" 
"/home/runner/work/_actions/edumserrano/markdown-link-check-log-parser/v1"
```

Note that the `docker build` command points to the Dockerfile at `/home/runner/work/markdown-link-check-log-parser/markdown-link-check-log-parser/v1/Dockerfile`. What is happening here is that GitHub clones the action's repository into the GitHub runner's working directory of the repo making use of this action. The clone of action's repo will be under the `_actions` folder.

This way it can successfully build the Dockerfile for this action which would otherwise fail since the Dockerfile references files in the action's repository which would not be present in the repository making use of this action.

**Example:**

- Repository `hello-world` creates a workflow that uses the `Markdown Link Check log parser` action.
- When the workflow is executing, it contains a setup step that runs before any of the workflow defined steps. This step will clone the `Markdown Link Check log parser` action's repo into the runner's working directory under the `_actions` folder and build the Docker container.
- This allows the Dockerfile to reference files in the `Markdown Link Check log parser` repo even though the workflow has not explicitly checked it out.

### As of writing this, the log for running the docker action looks as follows

```
/usr/bin/docker run
--name cd98f236c6972581e50e94bc7f786208c8965_460ab9

4cd98f:236c6972581e50e94bc7f786208c8965 <action input parameters>

```

When running the docker container there are lots of docker parameters set. Besides all the environment variables note that there are several volume mounts. More importantly, note that the contents of the checked out repo where the action is executing is mounted into the container at `/github/workspace` and that the `workdir` is also set to `/github/workspace`.

This allows the GitHub action to access the files checked out by the workflow and is what allows users to then access the JSON/Markdown files produced by this action once the action finishes and the docker container is terminated.

**Example:**

- Repository `hello-world` creates a workflow that uses the `Markdown Link Check log parser` action.
- We set the `output` input parameter of the `Markdown Link Check log parser` action to `json, md` and we set the `json-filepath` to `./output.json` and the `markdown-filepath` to `./output.md`.
- When the workflow is executing the Docker container is will output the JSON/Markdown file to the github workspace with the chosen names because because the contents of the checked out `hello-world` repo are mounted into the Docker container at `/github/workspace`. Furthermore the `json-filepath`  and `markdown-filepath` input parameters don't need to start with `/github/workspace` because the `workdir` parameter is set to `/github/workspace` when executing the Docker container.
- When the action finishes and the container is terminated the user can access the JSON file at `${{ github.workspace}}/output.json` and the Markdown file at `${{ github.workspace}}/output.md`.
